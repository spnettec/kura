emitallchannelsname=emitall channels
emitallchannelsdesc=Specifies wheter the values of all READ or READ_WRITE channels should be emitted in case of a channel event. If set to true, the values for all channels will be read and emitted, if set to false, only the value for the channel related to the event will be emitted.
timestampmodename=timestamp mode
timestampmodedesc=If set to PER_CHANNEL, the component will emit a driver-generated timestamp per channel property. If set to SINGLE_ASSET_GENERATED, the component will emit a single timestamp per request, generated by the Asset itself before emitting the envelope. If set to SINGLE_DRIVER_GENERATED_MAX or SINGLE_DRIVER_GENERATED_MIN, the component will emit a single driver generated timestamp being respectively the max (most recent) or min (oldest) among the timestamps of the channels.
emiterrorsname=emit errors
emiterrorsdesc=Specifies wheter errors should be included or not in the emitted envelope
emitonchange=emit on change
emitonchangedesc=If set to true, this component will include a channel value in the output emitted in Kura Wires" only if it is different than the one from the previous read operation or event. Channel errors will always be emitted if emit.errors is set to true.
emitemptyenvelopes=emit empty envelopes
emitemptyenvelopesdesc=If set to false, this component will not emit empty envelopes. This property can be useful if combined with emit.on.change.
